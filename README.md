# pmarca Tweeter

This is just a web app. The data is trained and sampled on my local machine and dumped into the mongo backend, which is then pushed to Heroku. The training set is a preprocessed text dump of @pmarca's tweets. All credit goes to Andrej Karpathy for the LSTM implementation (https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).
